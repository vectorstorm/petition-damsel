VectorStorm is intended to be a professional-grade game engine for
two purposes.

First, to serve as an educational jumping off point for programmers
who are comfortable writing console applications, and are ready to
start thinking about graphical ideas, but not yet ready to create
an entire game engine.

Second, to serve as a rapid gameplay prototyping platform for
myself and for others.


By solely supporting 2D vector graphic games, VectorStorm prevents
game programmers from obsessing over graphics, and focuses attention
squarely on the gameplay code.


VectorStorm is distributed under the GPLv3 license, but please
feel free to contact me if you'd like to discuss alternate
licensing arrangements.
